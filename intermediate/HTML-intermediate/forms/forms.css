 /*  Inheriting should change their fonts to that of the parent's font family.
 strange exception â€” <input type="submit"> does not inherit from the parent paragraph in Chrome.
  Rather, it uses the font-family: system-ui.
  
  
  This is another reason to use <button> elements over their equivalent input types!

  /* legend styling
  
  The <legend> element is okay to style, but it can be a bit tricky to control placement of it. 
  By default it is always positioned over the top border of its <fieldset> parent, near the top left corner.
