    <!-- The <thead> element must wrap the part of the table that is the header — 
        this is usually the first row containing the column headings,
         but this is not necessarily always the case. 
         If you are using <col>/<colgroup> element, the table header should come just below those.


The <tfoot> element needs to wrap the part of the table that is the footer — 
    this might be a final row with items in the previous rows summed, for example.
     You can include the table footer right at the bottom of the table as you'd expect,
      or just below the table header (the browser will still render it at the bottom of the table).


The <tbody> element needs to wrap the other parts of the table content that aren't in the table header or footer.
     It will appear below the table header or sometimes footer,
      depending on how you decided to structure it. -->


      <!-- <tbody> is always included in every table, implicitly if you don't specify it in your code.
         To check this, open up one of your previous examples that doesn't include <tbody> and look
             at the HTML code in your browser developer tools
              — you will see that the browser has added this tag for you.
               You might wonder why you ought to bother including it at all 
               — you should, because it gives you more control over your table structure and styling. -->
