Viewport Width (vw) – A percentage of the full viewport width.
 10vw will resolve to 10% of the current viewport width, or 48px on a phone that is 480px wide.
  The difference between % and vw is most similar to the difference between em and rem. 
  A % length is relative to local context (containing element) width,
   while a vw length is relative to the full width of the browser window.


Viewport Height (vh) – A percentage of the full viewport height.
 10vh will resolve to 10% of the current viewport height.


Viewport Minimum (vmin) – A percentage of the viewport width or height,
 whichever is smaller. 10vmin will resolve to 10% of the current viewport width in portrait
  orientations, and 10% of the viewport height on landscape orientations.


Viewport Maximum (vmax) – A percentage of the viewport width or height, whichever is larger.
 10vmax will resolve to 10% of the current viewport height in portrait orientations, 
 and 10% of the viewport width on landscape orientations.
  Sadly, and strangely, vmax units are not yet available on Internet Explorer or Edge.



  --to control rate of scaling use calc()

  body {
  // font grows 1px for every 100px of viewport width
  font-size: calc(16px + 1vw);
  // leading grows along with font,
  // with an additional 0.1em + 0.5px per 100px of the viewport
  line-height: calc(1.1em + 0.5vw);
}

--setting max of scaling 

h1 {
  font-size: calc(1.2em + 3vw);
}

@media (min-width: 50em) {
  h1 {
    font-size: 50px;
  }
}


--fluid aspect ratios

.full-width {
  width: 100vw;
  max-width: 30em;
  height: calc(100vw * (9/16));
  max-height: calc(30em * (9/16));
}

(9: 16 aspect ratio)


-- line breaking of elements out of the container

.full-width {
  margin-left: calc(50% - 50vw);
  margin-right: calc(50% - 50vw);
}
